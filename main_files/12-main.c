13. Nodes
mandatory
Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

Prototype: size_t binary_tree_nodes(const binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to count the number of nodes
If tree is NULL, the function must return 0
A NULL pointer is not a node
